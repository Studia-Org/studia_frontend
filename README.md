# 🚀 Getting started

Studia frontend is built using React and Tailwind. React is an open-source JavaScript library for building user interfaces in single-page applications. Its component-based architecture allows for reusable and efficient UI development. Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that offers a customizable set of low-level utility classes for rapid and flexible web design.
When combined, React and Tailwind CSS provide a powerful duo for creating modern, interactive, and visually appealing web applications with streamlined development and extensive styling capabilities.
